# Cybo

A browser-ready synchronicity playground styled like a retro Commander Keen space adventure. Pick a probability well, focus your intent, and collapse reality using secure randomness.

## Running
Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser—no build step required. The experience uses CDN React + Babel and `window.crypto.getRandomValues` for all randomness (never `Math.random`).

## How to play
1. Hover over the wells and pick the one you want to collapse.
2. Hold **Breathe & Steady** to fill your resonance meter and roleplay your intent.
3. Hit **Collapse Reality** to reveal the branch your timeline landed on. Alternate futures appear as “ghosts.”
4. Keep chaining aligned collapses to build your streak and chase your personal high score.
